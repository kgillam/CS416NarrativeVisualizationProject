        “Breastfeeding provides unmatched health benefits for babies and mothers. It is the clinical gold standard for
        infant feeding and nutrition, with breast milk uniquely tailored to meet the health needs of a growing baby. We
        must do more to create supportive and safe environments for mothers who choose to breastfeed.”

        - Dr. Ruth Petersen, director of CDC’s Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity
    </p>
    <p>
        Breastfeeding has health benefits for both the baby and the birthing parent. Infants who are breastfed have lower risk
        of sudden infant death syndrome, asthma, obesity, gastrointestinal infections, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Health organizations such as American Academy of Pediatrics and The World Health Organization recommend that infants
        be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months, with continued breastfeeding along with complimentary foods after.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most infants receive some breast milk, but are not exclusively breastfeeding, and are not continuing to breastfeed
        for as long as recommended.
    </p>

        The CDC has several initiatives to support and promote breastfeeding. This includes promoting best practices in healthcare
        settings, working with states to help employers support breastfeeding mothers, and encouraging access to community
        resources such as supplemental nutrition programs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CDC collects data about breastfeeding to track how long infants are being breastfed, and what kind of support
        new parents are receiving to assist in breastfeeding. Analyzing this data can help inform which groups and regions
        are in need of additional resources supporting breastfeeding.
    </p>

<div id="Page3" class="page" style="display:none">
    <p>
        There are many factors that influence a parent's decision on how to feed their infant.
        Parents may have health-related reasons to not breastfeed, such as concerns with taking medications while breastfeeding.
        Some mothers need to supplement breastmilk with formula due to low breast milk quantity.
        Unsupportive work policies and lack of parental leave may make it difficult to work while lactating.
        Cultural norms or lack of family support can make breastfeeding difficult to manage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Breastfeeding rates vary by region. Infants in rural areas are less likely to be breastfed than infants in urban areas.
        Babies in the southeast United States are less likely to still be breastfed at 6 months than babies in other areas of
        the country.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are also breastfeeding disparities between demographics. Mother's with different age groups, ethnicities, and WIC
        participation status have different rates of breastfeeding.
