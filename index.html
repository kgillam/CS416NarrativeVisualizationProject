                        “Breastfeeding provides unmatched health benefits for babies and mothers. It is the clinical gold standard for
                        infant feeding and nutrition, with breast milk uniquely tailored to meet the health needs of a growing baby. We
                        must do more to create supportive and safe environments for mothers who choose to breastfeed.”

                    Breastfeeding has health benefits for both the baby and the birthing parent. Infants who are breastfed have lower risk
                    of sudden infant death syndrome, asthma, obesity, gastrointestinal infections, etc.  Most infants receive
                    some breast milk, but are not exclusively breastfeeding, and are not continuing to breastfeed
                    for as long as recommended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Health organizations such as American Academy of Pediatrics and The World Health Organization recommend that infants
                    be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months, with continued breastfeeding along with complimentary foods after.

            <H2>Factors Affecting Breastfeeding Rates</H2>
            <div class = "p_group">
                <p>
                    There are many factors that influence a parent's decision on how to feed their infant.
                    Parents may have health-related reasons to not breastfeed, such as concerns with taking medications while breastfeeding.
                    Some mothers need to supplement breastmilk with formula due to low breast milk quantity.
                    Unsupportive work policies and lack of parental leave may make it difficult to work while lactating.
                    And cultural norms or lack of family support can make breastfeeding difficult to manage.

                <p>
                    Breastfeeding rates vary by region. Infants in rural areas are less likely to be breastfed than infants in urban areas.
                    Babies in the southeast United States are less likely to still be breastfed at 6 months than babies in other areas of
                    the country. There are also breastfeeding disparities between demographics. Mother's with different age groups, ethnicities, and WIC
                    participation status have different rates of breastfeeding. The level of disparity between demographic
                    groups may also vary by region.

                        The CDC has several initiatives to support and promote breastfeeding. This includes promoting best practices in healthcare
                        settings, working with states to help employers support breastfeeding mothers, and encouraging access to community
                        resources such as supplemental nutrition programs.

                    <p>
                        The CDC collects data about breastfeeding to track how long infants are being breastfed, and what kind of support
                        new parents are receiving to assist in breastfeeding. Analyzing this data can help inform which groups and regions
                        are in need of additional resources supporting breastfeeding.
